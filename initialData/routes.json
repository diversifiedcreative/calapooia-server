        "description": "This run follows Upper Calapooia Road/NF-2820 through a lengthy stretch of privately-held timberland. The road is often open, but parking/stopping on the road is prohibited between the gate near the the end-of-pavement and the borders of the Willamette National Forest and Weyerhaeuser maintains the right to close/control the road as needed. Observe all signs and scout/plan ahead. Likely not runnable in summer."
